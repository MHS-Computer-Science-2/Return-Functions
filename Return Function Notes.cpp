// Return Functions
// I CAN explain the purpose of functions in C++
// I CAN write and call return functions

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Functions should be written ABOVE main()



int main()
{
	//EXAMPLE 1
	//Consider a function from math class: f(x) = 6x - 9
	// What is f(4)?
	// What is f(-5)?
	// What is f(0)?

	//Let's teach C++ to do this function for us



	//f is the ______________ (name) of the function 
	//You can use any name that you want

	//4, -5, and 0 are ______________. These are the inputs to the function.


	//EXAMPLE 2
	//Let's write a function that computes the perimeter of a rectangle
	//with length 5 and width 12

	

	//EXAMPLE 3
	// TRY IT: Write a function that returns the average of 2 numbers
	//double a = average(3, 6);
	//cout << "The average is: " << a << endl;


	//WHY FUNCTIONS?
	//Functions serve two main purposes:
	// 1. _____________. We can write the code once and call it over and over.
	// 2. _____________. We can break one large task into smaller subtasks.
